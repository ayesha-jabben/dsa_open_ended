Title: Delete N nodes after M nodes of a linked list
Objective:
Develop a program that manipulates a singly linked list based on specific user-defined rules. Explore how linked list operations can be customized to solve problems by implementing a feature to delete n nodes after skipping m nodes, repeating this until the end of the list.

Task Instructions:
⦁	Program Requirements:
⦁	Write a function that takes the following inputs:
⦁	A linked list of integers.
⦁	Two integers m (number of nodes to skip) and n (number of nodes to delete).
⦁	The function should repeatedly skip m nodes and delete the next n nodes until it reaches the end of the list.
⦁	Flexibility in Implementation:
⦁	Provide flexibility to the user to input their own linked list (either via console input or as hardcoded values).
⦁	Allow users to experiment with different values for m and n.
⦁	Output Requirements:
⦁	Display the original linked list and the resulting linked list after applying the operation.
⦁	Include appropriate error handling, such as when m or n are negative or when the linked list is empty.

Submission Requirements:
⦁	Submit the program code along with comments explaining key sections of your implementation.
⦁	Optional: Submit screenshots of sample outputs or visualizations if implemented.
